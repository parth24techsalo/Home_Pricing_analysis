# Project Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the price of a house based on various features. The main steps include data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains various features related to houses, such as the number of rooms, location, age of the property, and more. You can download the dataset from Kaggle or any other relevant source.[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/housing-prices-dataset?resource=download]

# Installation
You can also run the project directly in Google Colab, which has these libraries pre-installed.

# Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing steps include:

Handling missing values by filling or dropping them.
Encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
Standardizing numerical features to bring them onto a comparable scale.

# Modeling
The project uses a Linear Regression model to predict house prices. The steps include:

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Scaling the features using StandardScaler.
Training the Linear Regression model on the training data.
Saving the trained model using pickle for future use.

# Evaluation
The model is evaluated using the following metrics:

R2 Score: Measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): The average of the squares of the errors between the actual and predicted values.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The square root of the MSE, providing an error metric in the same unit as the target variable.

# Conclusion
This project provides a framework for predicting house prices using machine learning. It covers the complete pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation, providing insights into the factors that influence house prices.
